What is PyCamps?
================
PyCamps is inspired by the Perl based `DevCamps project <http://devcamps.org/>`_ created by `EndPoint <http://www.endpoint.com/>`_. The idea is simply to make it easy for developers to have their own little environments to build web applications. 

Please see the `PyCamps project site <http://projects.purpleatom.com/pycamps/>`_ to get started.
